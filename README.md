# Task Board Starter Code
Task Board Application - Third-Party APIs Challenge
Project Overview
This project is a Task Board Application designed to help project teams manage tasks by visually organizing them in columns that represent their current state of progress (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed). The application is powered by jQuery and uses Day.js to handle date manipulations. This intuitive and interactive interface allows users to add tasks, manage their progress, and track deadlines with ease. All tasks are saved in localStorage, ensuring that data persists even after refreshing the page.

Features
Dynamic Task Display: Tasks are displayed in three columns, representing their state (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed).
Color-Coded Deadlines: Tasks are color-coded to indicate their urgency:
Yellow: Task is nearing its deadline.
Red: Task is overdue.
Interactive Task Management: Users can:
Add new tasks via a modal dialog.
Drag tasks between columns to update their progress.
Delete tasks from the board.
Persistent Data: Tasks are saved in localStorage and will persist even after the page is refreshed.
Date Handling: The application utilizes the Day.js library to manage and display due dates for tasks.

Technologies Used
HTML5 and CSS3 for the structure and styling of the task board.
JavaScript and jQuery for interactivity and functionality.
Day.js for handling dates.
localStorage to save task data and ensure persistence.
